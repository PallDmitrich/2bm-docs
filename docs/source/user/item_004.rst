Sample Alignment
================

.. contents:: 
   :local:

Load the sample on the kinematic mount at:

.. image:: ../img/tomo_refs.png 
   :width: 480px
   :align: center
   :alt: tomo_user

then using:

.. image:: ../img/item_001.png 
   :width: 720px
   :align: center
   :alt: tomo_user


move it up/down by adjusting the TomoY motor in the positive/negative direction. To center the sample on the rotation axis, rotate the sample at 0 degree and adjust Tomo@0deg till the sample is in the middle of the image at both position, then move the rotary stage at 90 deg and adjust Tomo@90deg to move the sample again in the middle of the image.
