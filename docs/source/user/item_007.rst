Data download
=============

At the beginning of the beamtime all users listed in the proposal receive an email with instructions on how to download data from the APS.

Data sets are distributed using a `Globus <https://www.globus.org>`_, to use it you need to create 
a `Globus Account <https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/>`_  and set up you computer as 
a `Globus EndPoint <https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal>`_.

Raw Data Viewer 
---------------

To view the tomographic raw data we suggest to install `Fiji <https://imagej.net/Fiji>`_ and add 
the `HDF plugin <https://github.com/paulscherrerinstitute/ch.psi.imagej.hdf5>`_

Other options are `hdfview <https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/>`_ or 
`argos <https://github.com/titusjan/argos>`_
